  <h2>THE IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h2>
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have had a profound impact
  on many aspects of the healthcare industry. Advances in technology have opened
  the way for the analysis of large databases in a cost-effective and
  time-consuming manner. Clinical oncology and research reap the benefits of AI.

  <h2>IMPLEMENTING AI IN CANCER DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
  The burden of cancer is a global phenomenon. Efforts to reduce mortality rates
  need to be identified early in order to intervene effectively. However, for
  metastatic and recurrent cancer changes and develops drug resistance, it is
  important to identify biomarker novels that create drug resistance and
  identify therapeutic targets to improve treatment modalities. The introduction
  of next-generation follow-up (NGS) platforms to address these needs, has
  changed the future of intuitive oncology. NGS provides a number of clinical
  applications that are essential for risk assessment, early diagnosis,
  systematic diagnostic and therapeutic imaging, accurate prediction, biomarker
  identification and targeted clinical identification of new drug findings. NGS
  produces large data sets that require specialized bioinformatics resources to
  analyze relevant and important clinical data. With these AI applications,
  cancer diagnostics and predictive predictions are enhanced with NGS and a
  medical image that delivers high-resolution images.

  <h2>CHALLENGES AND GROWTH IN AI TECHNOLOGY</h2>

  Despite technological advances, AI has some challenges and limitations, and
  the clinical use of NGS will still be ensured. By continuing to advance the
  advancement of new technologies and technologies, the future of AI and
  accurate oncology shows great promise. Over the past 25 years, drug discovery
  has benefited from the use of many new methods and technologies. Subsequent
  generation sequences, as well as major RNA interference (RNAi) disruptions and
  the latest CRISPR technology, have been shown to be important in mechanical
  biological testing and targeted drug identification, particularly in oncology.
  We have seen the growth in size and diversity of chemical libraries.
  High-performance experiments, and the development of experiments using robots
  and microfluidics, have increased the availability of chemical substances that
  work on targeted drugs, while formulations based on construction and
  degradation have improved the lead and efficiency of smaller molecules. Also,
  integrated DNA technology has undergone changes in the design of antibodies to
  treat other organisms.

  <h2>LIMITATIONS OF CANCER DRUG DISCOVERY</h2>
  The serious problems with the drug discovery system revolve around drug
  discovery in education and chemical biology being on the rise, as well as new
  inventions and relationships between the various disciplines including
  education and the medical and biotechnology industry, which are now more
  widespread. These changes promote new inventions and help to share the risks
  of drug discovery. Mechanism-driven drug discovery has now become commonplace,
  empowered by the unprecedented understanding of the bases of disease cells.
  Oncology has seen a very large number of first-line drug approvals; this is
  based on the disclosure of pathogenic cell pathways most recently, following
  the genomes of tens of thousands of cancer patients and announcing a period of
  accurate drug oncology. As a result, many genetically engineered drugs can now
  be administered to patients with stratified cancer. These target drugs often
  exploit a specific addiction or vulnerability of a plant identified by the use
  of a molecular biomarker, which itself is labeled with the drug label. A new
  generation of immune-oncology drugs has a huge impact. On the other hand,
  although more than 50 percent of cancer patients now survive for more than a
  decade, many forms of the disease have serious side effects and drug abuse. In
  addition, oncology physicians and drug discriminators now face a significant
  challenge in coping with cancer-adaptive, adaptive, and therapeutic potential.
  At the same time, the Big Data revolution was gaining momentum again across
  many domains - affecting many aspects of our daily lives and many areas of
  research. This is a result of increasing availability and lower cost of
  technology for producing, storing and analyzing large and diverse data sets.
  Other components of multidisciplinary drug discovery have long embraced the
  methods of calculation and the collection and analysis of Big Data to
  facilitate decision-making, especially in medical chemistry. Mining of large
  amounts of raw biological data for targeted ideas is now commonplace. In
  addition, the future route of travel is indicated by the US FDA's introduction
  of oncology programs aimed at 'skipping the path to reducing drug development
  (for example, single driver-guided drug and traditional clinical trials) in a
  holistic approach (e.g., single driver-guided and general clinical trials)
  (for example, a combination of therapeutic interventions aimed at multiple
  signatures and real-world evidence). All in all, without any progress being
  made, the drug discovery community is far from seeing the full potential of
  Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) statistics.

  <h2>NEXT LEVEL WITH AI IN DRUG DISCOVERY</h2>

  The power of AI, especially in drug discovery, has become a major source of
  interest in many medical companies in recent years. There is no doubt that it
  has the potential to make medical researchers at the forefront of drug
  development with the tangible details found in informal data packs, in a
  relatively short period of time. High accuracy, improved visibility and
  efficiency are key pillars that strengthen the use of machine learning skills
  in health care systems.
